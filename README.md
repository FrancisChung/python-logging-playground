Place to play around with the Standard Python Logging Library

slogger.py contains a sample logger based on the standard logging library that correct changes loglevels without
using basicConfig that affects all loggers

main.py contains some sample test sequences showing the various scenarios where changing levels work and don't work. 

To run the tests: run python main.py to see the test results.

It's recommended to have main.py code side by side with the console results to understand the test output
